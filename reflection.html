            <h2>What I Learned</h2>
            <p>Over the course of this semester, I gained a deeper understanding of how technology and creativity can converge to create impactful work. From developing interactive p5.js sketches to styling portfolio websites, each project challenged me to think critically about design and functionality. I've learned not only the technical skills but also the importance of iteration and feedback in the creative process.</p>
            <h2>Challenges and Growth</h2>
            <p>One of the biggest challenges I faced was integrating complex interactions into my projects. Debugging code and refining user experiences required patience and persistence, but the results were incredibly rewarding. This experience taught me the value of problem-solving and resilience in creative computation.</p>
            <h2>Future Goals</h2>
            <p>Moving forward, I aim to further develop my skills in creative coding, with a particular focus on virtual and augmented reality. I aspire to design immersive experiences that blend art, technology, and storytelling. This class has been an inspiring stepping stone toward achieving those goals.</p>
