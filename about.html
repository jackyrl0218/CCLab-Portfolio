            <h2>Jack Yuan</h2>
            <p>Hi, I'm Jack Yuan, a creative enthusiast passionate about technology and design. I'm currently exploring the intersection of art and computation, developing projects that inspire and engage audiences. My journey began with a love for visual storytelling and evolved into a fascination with how code can bring ideas to life. Whether it's experimenting with interactive sketches or designing user experiences, I aim to merge creativity with functionality.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, you'll find me exploring new design trends, hiking with family, or experimenting with culinary arts. I also have a deep appreciation for large-scale installations and immersive art, which fuels my vision of creating meaningful, tech-driven experiences.</p>
